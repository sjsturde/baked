				<div class='faq--question'>
					<div class='faq--question-text'>What is the deal with Baked! anyways?</div>
					<button class="hamburger "></button>
				</div>
				<div class='faq--text'>We started in 2006 when Jared Schneider, the legendary and wise
					founder, got tired of the late-night delivery market in Bloomington. Realizing
					that Bloomington and IU needed a high quality, customizable way to satiate its
					sweet tooth — no matter what time of the day or night it was — the idea for
					Baked! was born! To make the perfect custom cookies, served fresh out of the
					oven, he adapted his mother’s tried-and-true family recipes until he arrived
					at our world-famous Sugar, Chocolate, Oatmeal, and Peanut Butter doughs, made
					a list of about 40 mixins, frostings, and afterbake options, and opened for
					business. We now pride ourselves on our ever-growing seasonal doughs
					(like Pumpkin, Blueberry Oatmeal, and Red Velvet), gluten-free and vegan
					doughs, custom cookie cakes, and Unbaked dough (raw dough made especially
					for eating out of a waffle cone). There’s a cookie for everyone, and anytime is a good time to get
					Baked!

			<div class='faq--question-container'>
				<div class='faq--question'>
					<div class='faq--question-text'>Do you deliver?</div>
					<button class="hamburger "></button>
				</div>
				<div class='faq--text'>Heck yes! Delivery has always been a huge part of
					Baked! and of life in Bloomington. We’ll deliver 9am - 4am (call for
					summer/holiday/break hours) for a small delivery fee. Please tip your
					driver for their excellent service! We are happy to take an order
					from you and send it to someone else, even if you won't be there
					to receive it. If you’re interested, please see the “I want to
					send cookies or a cookie cake to someone else. What do I need
					to do?” section of our FAQs, and give us a call at (812) 336-2253.

			<div class='faq--question-container'>
				<div class='faq--question'>
					<div class='faq--question-text'>Do you have online ordering?</div>
					<button class="hamburger "></button>
				</div>
				<div class='faq--text'>As of now, no. We're (slowly, very slowly) working on a
					system that we hope to get running in the future, but currently the only way to
					get Baked! is by calling up one of our friendly bakers at (812) 336-2253.

			<div class='faq--question-container'>
				<div class='faq--question'>
					<div class='faq--question-text'>When are you open?</div>
					<button class="hamburger "></button>
				</div>
				<div class='faq--text'>Our regular hours are 9am - 2am Sunday through Wednesday,
					and 9am to 4am Thursday through Saturday. We take walk-ins and delivery calls
					throughout business hours. Walk-in and pick-up wait times are typically
					20-30 minutes, and delivery times are usually within an hour (sometimes more
					during peak hours).

				<div class='faq--question'>
					<div class='faq--question-text'>How do I order?</div>
					<button class="hamburger "></button>
				</div>
				<div id="question--how">
					<div class='faq--text'>First, pick your dough. We always stock fresh,
						homemade Sugar, Chocolate, Oatmeal, and Peanut Butter dough, as well
						as a rotating variety of Seasonal, Gluten-Free, and Vegan doughs.
						<br><br>
						Second, choose your mixins. These are anything that we mix into the
						dough, right after your order and before the cookies bake. You can
						go as crazy with these as you’d like, but we recommend no more than
						three or four mixins per type of cookie.
						<br><br>
						Finally, choose your afterbakes (small $0.50 upcharge per three
						cookies for these). Pick from our house-made Vanilla, Chocolate,
						Cream Cheese, or Oreo Cream Cheese frostings, drizzles like Caramel
						and Honey, and candy like Hershey’s Kisses, Marshmallows, Reese’s
						Peanut Butter Cups, Snickers, Kit-Kat, Milky Way, Twix, or
						3-Musketeers to top off your unique cookie combinations.

				<div class='faq--question'>
					<div class='faq--question-text'>I want to send cookies or a cookie
						cake to someone else. What do I need to do?</div>
					<button class="hamburger "></button>
				</div>
				<div class='faq--text'>No problem! We can usually send milk and cookies
					within an hour of contacting the recipient, or a cookie cake the same
					day if ordered before 5pm. Just call us at (812) 336-2253 and give us
					a few pieces of information:
					<div class='faq_list'>
						<li>Your name and phone number</li>
						<li>The recipient’s name and number (or the name and number of
							someone that will be with the recipient if you’d like it to remain a surprise)</li>
						<li>Delivery address</li>
						<li>Date and time of intended order</li>
						<li>Have your payment ready at the end of the call</li>
					</div>
					Please keep in mind that we are unable to guarantee “surprise” orders.
					Typically we try to contact the recipient 1-2 hours before the intended
					delivery time, and to ensure that the recipient receives a hot,
					fresh order, nothing is baked until after the recipient has confirmed
					they will be home. There is also an additional processing fee ($1.25)
					to cover over-the-phone credit card transaction costs.

				<div class='faq--question'>
					<div class='faq--question-text'>What's your allergy policy?</div>
					<button class="hamburger "></button>
				</div>
				<div class='faq--text'>During our operations, our staff regularly handle dairy, eggs,
					peanuts, tree nuts, cocoa, cinnamon, coconut, wheat, soy, and other spices
					and seasonally available ingredients. All of these allergens may have come
					in contact with any or all of our available products. We’re unfortunately
					unable to guarantee that any cookie combinations can be produced free of
					allergens. We can, however, suggest some that are more likely to be free
					of food-borne allergens. If you have a food allergy, we strongly recommend
					that you only order Sugar-Chocolate Chip cookies, as demand for this
					best-seller allows us to pre-mix this dough with greater attention paid
					to physical cross-contamination with allergens.
					<br>
					We also pride ourselves on having high quality, customizable options for
					Gluten-Free or Vegan customers. At this time, we carry separate Gluten-Free
					and Vegan doughs (but not one single dough that is both Gluten-Free and Vegan).
					To help ensure the fidelity of these doughs with respect to our customers’
					allergy concerns,
					<br>
					<li>We do not offer Gluten-Free cookies with mixins that include
						gluten (Oreos, Graham Crackers, Brownie Bites, Cheesecake Bites,
						Pretzels).</li>> <br>
					<li>Mixins that are Gluten-Free include Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chips,
						White Chocolate Chips, Dark Chocolate Chips, Butterscotch Chips,
						Mint Chips, Cappuccino Chips, Sprinkles, Raisins, Craisins,
						Toffee, Reese’s Pieces, M&Ms, Peanut M&Ms, Peanut Butter Chips,
						Peanuts, Mixed Nuts, Walnuts, Macadamia Nuts, Cinnamon Sugar,
						Coconut, Dark Chocolate Covered Espresso Beans,
						and Andes Mints.
					</li>><br>
					<li>We do not offer Vegan cookies with mixins that are not vegan
						(Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chips, White Chocolate Chips, Mint Chips,
						Butterscotch Chips, Cappuccino Chips, M&Ms, Peanut M&Ms,
						Reese’s Pieces, Peanut Butter Chips, Cheesecake Bites,
						Toffee, Graham Crackers, Brownie Bites, Sprinkles,
						and Andes Mints).
					</li>><br>
					<li>Mixins that are Vegan include Dark Chocolate Chips, Oreos,
						Raisins, Craisins, Coconut, Macadamia Nuts, Walnuts, Mixed Nuts,
						Peanuts, Pretzels, Cinnamon Sugar,
						and Dark Chocolate Covered Espresso Beans.
					</li>><br>
					Although we aren’t able to guarantee that any item is completely free
					of allergen cross-contamination, if you clearly inform us when you
					order that you prefer a nut-safe, gluten-free, or vegan order,
					we’ll make sure to use fresh, clean utensils, pans, and equipment
					to mix, bake and box your order from start to finish.

				<div class='faq--question'>
					<div class='faq--question-text'>What is sludge?</div>
					<button class="hamburger "></button>
				</div>
				<div class='faq--text'>Sludge dough is a little bit of all of our doughs and mixins put
					together. It is created when we make up your custom cookie order,
					and have just a little bit too much of the dough and mixins that you
					chose. When we have enough of it (which is usually), we bake it into
					huge bars ready for you to grab and go. Sludge dough is also great
					for rounding out that last type of cookie in your dozen when you
					already chose three types and can&#8217t think of the rest! Order some
					sludge cookies anytime, but keep in mind that it is on special every
					Monday and Tuesday for only $10 per dozen.
